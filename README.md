# Crop Recommendation System

## Project Description
This is my final year project.

Problem: climate change is a topic that has become the attention of many including global leaders, heads of states and global organizations like the United Nations. Farmers in Kenya have been largely affected as they rely majorly on weather to grow crops. It has however become difficult to decide which crop to grow due to the changes in climate change which has created uncertainty in the weather.

Suppose there was a way to determine what crop would do best in your farm given the weather conditions and the soil on your farm?

The main objective of this project, as such, is to develop a machine learning model that can recommend to farmers the most suitable crop to grow based on the prevailing weather conditions and soil parameters.

The project provides a way for the farmer to interact with the trained model. How?ü§î Through a very friendly interface developed using kotlin and android studio (A mobile appüòÉ!)

Guess what? This project aligns with SDG goals to promote sustainable development. SDG GOAL 2: ZERO HUNGER


The code is above! HAVE FUN!üòÅ

## Steps followed:
1. Trained a machine learning model using google colab.
2. Exported and downloaded the model to use and created an API.
2. Created an API using Flask to deploy the trained model.
3. Tested the created API using Postman.
4. Deployed the Flask API using vercel.

6. Created a usable interface - mobile app to interact with the trained model.
